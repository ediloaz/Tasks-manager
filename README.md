## Output

In a latex presentation is showed the result of this. The information is the following:
* Cover (of the University)
* Short explain about the Algorithm Simplex
* Problem with math representation
* Initial table
* Intermediate tables
* Final table
* Solution
* Special cases

A .tex file is created and convert to pdf with *pdflatex command*  and is opened with *evince command*. All these files are saved in **Salida** folder.

Also, detected and explained if the problem had the following special cases:
1. Not Limited Problem
2. Not Feasible Problem
3. Degenerated Problem
4. Problem with multiple solutions


### Prerequisites

It is necessary to have installed *latex* (including *pdflatex*), *pkg-config* and *evince* in your linux. You can install it with the following commands:
```
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```
```
sudo apt-get install evince
```
```
sudo apt install pkg-config
```

## Running

First is necessary compile the main file (*main.c*) with the command
```
 gcc -o gladewin main.c -Wall `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` -export-dynamic -w
```

and then it can be opened
```
